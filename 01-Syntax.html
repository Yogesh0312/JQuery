    <h1>JQuery Syntax</h1>


    <!-- jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. 

    The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on
    your website.

    jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript
    code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that
    you can call with a single line of code.

    jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript,
    like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

    The jQuery library contains the following features:

    HTML/DOM manipulation
    CSS manipulation
    HTML event methods
    Effects and animations
    AJAX
    Utilities

    Tip: In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.

    Why jQuery?

    There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there,
    but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.

    Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:

    Google
    Microsoft
    IBM
    Netflix


    There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:

    Method-1

    Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
    Downloading jQuery
    There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:

    Production version - this is for your live website because
    it has been minified and compressed

    Development version - this is for testing and development
    (uncompressed and readable code)
    Both versions can be downloaded from jQuery.com.

    The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML
    <script> tag(notice that the < script > tag should be inside the < head > section):

        <head>
            <script src="jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
    </head>





    Method-2 Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google
    jQuery CDN
    If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself,
    you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

    Google is an example of someone who host jQuery:




    <head>
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    </head>

    syntax
-->

    <script>
//use in head or Body
    </script>

    <!--you can use anywhere jquery code

    
    



     The Document Ready Event 
    You might have noticed that all jQuery methods in our examples, are inside a document ready event: -->

    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {

            // jQuery methods go here...

        });
    </script>

    <!-- This is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document
    is finished loading (is ready).






    jQuery Syntax
    The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).

    Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()

    A $ sign to define/access jQuery
    A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
    A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)
    Examples:

    $(this).hide() - hides the current element.

    $("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.

        $(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".

        $("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test"

    -->




    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.js"

    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {

            $(".mybtn").click(function () {
                $("p").hide();
            })

            $(".btn1").click(function () {

                $(".myclass").hide()

            })

            $("#btn2").click(function () {

                $("#myid").hide()

            })

            $("#btn3").click(function () {

                $(this).hide()

            })

        });
    </script>
